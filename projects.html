    <p class="experience">I joined<a href="https://wearecodenation.com">CodeNation</a>on their introduction to coding Bootcamp. During my three weeks course, I have learned the fundamentals of Python, HTML and CSS. The course uses a hand on approach, where you can use what you learned to build projects. Part of the curriculum was to build a text-based game as a team using python. Tt was a challenging project which required a lot of research and creativity. After a week of working on the game, we managed to code a Trivia game. The game allowed the user to choose the genre of the trivia questions, as well as, the difficulty level of the question. Users were asked if they wanted to choose Easy, Medium or Hard questions. A score was counted for every difficulty level, as well as, an overall total score</p>
    <h1 class="videogame">Video of the game will be uploded soon!</h1>
